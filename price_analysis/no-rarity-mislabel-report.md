# Mislabeled "No Rarity" Japanese 1996 Base Set Pokemon Cards Report

**Generated:** January 22, 2026
**Platforms Searched:** eBay, Fanatics Collect
**Grading Companies:** BGS (Beckett), CGC only

---

## Executive Summary

Searched for BGS and CGC graded Japanese 1996 Base Set holo cards that may be labeled as "Rare" (R) on the grading label but are actually "No Rarity" variants (missing the star symbol). No Rarity variants are significantly more valuable - often 2-10x the price of standard Rare versions.

**Key Finding:** Most sellers who have No Rarity cards are aware of the premium and explicitly label them as such. However, I identified several listings that warrant closer inspection due to pricing anomalies or unclear labeling.

## HIGH PRIORITY - Requires Visual Inspection

### 1. CGC 9 Alakazam - POTENTIAL MISLABEL
**eBay Item:** 116473812670
**Price:** $148.00
**URL:** https://www.ebay.com/itm/116473812670

**Why This Is Suspicious:**
- Item specifics list "Holo Rare" as rarity
- BUT the eBay category/breadcrumb navigation references "Alakazam Expansion Pack (No Rarity) Holo (Japanese)"
- This conflicting metadata suggests possible mislabeling
- At $148 for a CGC 9, this would be SEVERELY underpriced if it's actually No Rarity

**Recommendation:** HIGH PRIORITY - Request close-up photos of bottom-right corner immediately

---

### 2. BGS 7.5 Gyarados - CHECK LABEL
**eBay Item:** 275830722240
**Price:** $93.01 (or Best Offer)
**URL:** https://www.ebay.com/itm/275830722240

**Why This Is Suspicious:**
- Title: "1996 GYARADOS POKEMON TCG JAPANESE BASE SET #130 BGS 7.5"
- No explicit "Rare" or "R" mentioned in visible listing content
- Price seems low for the grade - could be standard pricing OR could be mislabeled No Rarity
- Note: There's a data discrepancy (title says 7.5, specs say grade 10)

**Recommendation:** MEDIUM PRIORITY - Verify BGS label text and examine card photos

---

### 3. CGC 8.5 Blastoise - VERIFY RARITY
**eBay Item:** 406560487667
**Price:** $225.00
**URL:** https://www.ebay.com/itm/406560487667

**Why This Is Suspicious:**
- Title uses "Holo" but omits "Rare"
- Item specs say "Holo Rare" but title inconsistency is notable
- At $225 for CGC 8.5, this would be underpriced if No Rarity

**Recommendation:** MEDIUM PRIORITY - Request detailed photos

---

### 4. CGC 9.5 Venusaur - LABEL AMBIGUITY
**eBay Item:** 116955082102
**Price:** $350.00
**URL:** https://www.ebay.com/itm/116955082102

**Why This Is Suspicious:**
- Label specifically uses "VENUSAUR-HOLO" rather than "Holo Rare"
- CGC sometimes uses different terminology
- Price is reasonable for standard Rare but would be a steal for No Rarity

**Recommendation:** MEDIUM PRIORITY - Examine CGC label closely

## Verification Checklist

When examining listings, look for:

1. **BGS Label Format:** Look for "HOLO R" or just "HOLO" designation
2. **CGC Label Format:** Look for "Holo Rare" vs just "Holo" designation
3. **Card Bottom-Right Corner:** No Rarity cards have NO star symbol
4. **Price Comparison:**
   - If priced like standard Rare but is No Rarity = OPPORTUNITY
   - No Rarity typically 5-10x standard Rare pricing

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Contact seller of CGC 9 Alakazam (Item 116473812670) for close-up photos - the category metadata discrepancy is highly suspicious

2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Request photos from these sellers showing bottom-right corner:
   - BGS 7.5 Gyarados (275830722240)
   - CGC 8.5 Blastoise (406560487667)
   - CGC 9.5 Venusaur (116955082102)

3. **ONGOING:** Set up eBay saved searches with alerts for:
   - "BGS Japanese base [card name] holo" (without "no rarity")
   - "CGC Japanese base [card name] holo" (without "no rarity")
   - Filter by price ranges that seem low for the grade

4. **VERIFICATION:** For any potential find, always:
   - Request multiple high-res photos
   - Zoom in on bottom-right corner of card
   - Compare pricing to known No Rarity sales
   - Check eBay sold listings for comparable sales

## Market Context

**No Rarity Value Premium Examples:**
- BGS 7 Charizard No Rarity: $13,000-15,500
- BGS 7 Charizard Holo Rare: $400-600
- Premium: ~25-30x

- BGS 8 Gyarados No Rarity: $2,500
- BGS 8 Gyarados Holo Rare: ~$150-200
- Premium: ~12-16x

**Why Mislabels Happen:**
- Grading companies label based on card's rarity tier (Rare, Uncommon, Common)
- They don't distinguish between No Rarity symbol vs. Rarity symbol variants
- Labels show "HOLO R" meaning "Holographic Rare" - the R is for rarity tier, not rarity symbol
- Sellers may not realize the difference
