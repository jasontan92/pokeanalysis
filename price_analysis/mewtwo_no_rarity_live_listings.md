## Important Notes

### About No Rarity Cards
The No Rarity cards were the very first Pokemon TCG cards ever released in October 1996. They lack the rarity symbol (star) in the bottom right corner. The printing error was corrected within 2-3 weeks.

### Population Data
- **PSA 10:** Only 8-10 graded worldwide
- **PSA 9:** Approximately 43 graded
- No Rarity Mewtwo is significantly rarer than versions with rarity symbol

### Swirl Premium
Cards with visible "swirl" patterns in the holographic foil command premium prices.

### Marketplace Access
- **Yahoo Japan Auctions:** Requires proxy service (Buyee, FROM JAPAN, Japan Rabbit)
