## Market Notes

- **Difficulty:** Chansey is among the most difficult Base Set holos to grade due to the holographic finish scratching easily and the lighter background making scratches more visible
- **No Rarity Symbol:** Japanese equivalent of English 1st Edition - cards from the original 1996 print run that lack the black star rarity symbol in the bottom right corner
- **PSA Population:** 45 total auction sales recorded worth $20,529.29 in value (PSA data)
- **Current Market:** BGS 9 copies listed around $1,500-1,600. Raw PSA 9 auction sales in late 2025 ranged $39-$80
- **Grading Note:** Most current listings are BGS graded rather than PSA - PSA 9 No Rarity specifically is scarce on market
